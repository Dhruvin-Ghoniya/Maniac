# Maniacs - Unity Source Code

This repository contains the source code for **Maniacs**, a first-person zombie survival game developed in Unity.

## Unity Version

This project was developed using **Unity 2022.3.40f1**. Make sure to use the same version of Unity to avoid compatibility issues.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- **Assets/**: Contains all the main assets used in the project (models, textures, audio, etc.).
  - **Assets/Scripts/**: Contains all the scripts for the game mechanics, AI, and interactions.
  - **Assets/MyScenes/**: Contains the Unity scenes used in the game.
  
## Prerequisites

To run or modify the project, you'll need the following:

- **Unity Hub**: Download and install [Unity Hub](https://unity.com/download) if you haven't already.
- **Unity 2022.3.40f1**: This version of Unity is required. You can install it via Unity Hub.
- **Visual Studio** (or any other compatible IDE): You'll need an IDE to edit scripts. Visual Studio is recommended for Unity development, but any IDE with C# support will work.

## Setting Up the Project

1. **Install Unity Hub**: If you haven't installed Unity Hub yet, you can download it from [here](https://unity.com/download).
   
2. **Open the Project**:
   - Launch **Unity Hub** and click on the **'Add'** button to add the project folder.
   - Navigate to the repository folder and select it to open the project in Unity.

3. **Opening the Scene**: Once the project is loaded in Unity, navigate to the **Assets/MyScenes** folder in the Project window, and double-click on the scene you want to work on.

4. **Ensure Dependencies Are Installed**: Unity Hub will handle most dependencies automatically, but make sure your editor is set up with the necessary packages for your platform.

## Building the Game

To build the game for your target platform:

1. **Open the Build Settings**:
   - In Unity Editor, click on `File > Build Settings...` to open the build settings window.
   
2. **Build the Game**:
   - Click on the **Build** button in the Build Settings window.
   - Unity will automatically handle most default options.
   
3. **Targeting Other Platforms**:
   - If you wish to build for a platform other than the default (e.g., Android, iOS, etc.), you need to download the appropriate development kit (e.g., Android Build Support, iOS Build Support) through Unity Hub.
   - Modify the project as necessary to ensure compatibility with the target platform (e.g., adjusting input controls, screen resolutions, etc.).
